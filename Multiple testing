Multiple testing
When performing the test of a joint hypothesis, you might want to inspect the underlying 1-degree-
of-freedom hypotheses. Which constraint “is to blame”? test displays the univariate as well as the
simultaneous test if the mtest option is specified. For example,
. test [price=weight], common cons mtest
( 1) [price]foreign - [weight]foreign = 0
( 2) [price]_cons - [weight]_cons = 0
chi2 df p > chi2
(1) 23.07 1 0.0000*
(2) 11.17 1 0.0008*
All 51.23 2 0.0000
* Unadjusted p-values
Both coefficients seem to contribute to the highly significant result. The 1-degree-of-freedom test
shown here is identical to those if test had been invoked to test just this simple hypotheses. There is,
of course, a real risk in inspecting these simple hypotheses. Especially in high-dimensional hypotheses,
you may easily find one hypothesis that happens to be significant. Multiple testing procedures are
designed to provide some safeguard against this risk. p-values of the univariate hypotheses are modified
so that the probability of falsely rejecting one of the null hypotheses is bounded. test provides the
methods based on Bonferroni, Sid ˇ ak, and Holm. ´
. test [price=weight], common cons mtest(b)
( 1) [price]foreign - [weight]foreign = 0
( 2) [price]_cons - [weight]_cons = 0
chi2 df p > chi2
(1) 23.07 1 0.0000*
(2) 11.17 1 0.0017*
All 51.23 2 0.0000
* Bonferroni-adjusted p-values
Stored results
test and testparm store the following in r():
Scalars
r(p) two-sided p-value r(chi2) χ
2
r(F) F statistic r(ss) sum of squares (test)
r(df) test constraints degrees of freedom r(rss) residual sum of squares
r(df r) residual degrees of freedom r(drop) 1 if constraints were dropped, 0
r(dropped i) index of ith constraint dropped otherwise
Macros
r(mtmethod) method of adjustment for multiple
testing
Matrices
r(mtest) multiple test results
r(ss) and r(rss) are defined only when test is used for testing effects after anova.
