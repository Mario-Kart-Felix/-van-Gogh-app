6 test — Test linear hypotheses after estimation
equation(eqno) is relevant only for multiple-equation models, such as mvreg, mlogit, and heckman.
It specifies the equation for which the all-zero or all-equal hypothesis is tested. equation(#1)
specifies that the test be conducted regarding the first equation #1. equation(price) specifies
that the test concern the equation named price.
nosvyadjust is for use with svy estimation commands; see [SVY] svy estimation. It specifies that
the Wald test be carried out without the default adjustment for the design degrees of freedom. That
is, the test is carried out as W/k ∼ F(k, d) rather than as (d−k + 1)W/(kd) ∼ F(k, d−k + 1),
where k = the dimension of the test and d = the total number of sampled PSUs minus the total
number of strata. When the df() option is used, it will override the default design degrees of
freedom.
The following option is available with testparm but is not shown in the dialog box:
df(#) specifies that the F distribution with # denominator degrees of freedom be used for the
reference distribution of the test statistic. The default is to use e(df r) degrees of freedom or
the χ
2
distribution if e(df r) is missing. With survey data, # is the design degrees of freedom
unless nosvyadjust is specified.
