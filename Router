Using Router
next/link should be able to cover most of your routing needs, but you can also do client-side navigations without it, take a look at the documentation for next/router.

The following example shows how to do basic page navigations with useRouter:

import { useRouter } from 'next/router'

function ReadMore() {
  const router = useRouter()

  return (
    <span onClick={() => router.push('/about')}>Click here to read more</span>
  )
}

export default ReadMore
