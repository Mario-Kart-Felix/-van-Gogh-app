The Next.js CLI allows you to start, build, and export your application.

To get a list of the available CLI commands, run the following command inside your project directory:

npx next -h
(npx comes with npm 5.2+ and higher)

The output should look like this:

Usage
  $ next <command>

Available commands
  build, start, export, dev, telemetry

Options
  --version, -v   Version number
  --help, -h      Displays this message

For more information run a command with the --help flag
  $ next build --help
You can pass any node arguments to next commands:

NODE_OPTIONS='--throw-deprecation' next
NODE_OPTIONS='-r esm' next
NODE_OPTIONS='--inspect' next
Build
next build creates an optimized production build of your application. The output displays information about each route.

Size – The number of assets downloaded when navigating to the page client-side. The size for each route only includes its dependencies.
First Load JS – The number of assets downloaded when visiting the page from the server. The amount of JS shared by all is shown as a separate metric.
The first load is colored green, yellow, or red. Aim for green for performant applications.

You can enable production profiling for React with the --profile flag in next build. This requires Next.js 9.5:

next build --profile
After that, you can use the profiler in the same way as you would in development.

You can enable more verbose build output with the --debug flag in next build. This requires Next.js 9.5.3:

next build --debug
With this flag enabled additional build output like rewrites, redirects, and headers will be shown.

Development
next dev starts the application in development mode with hot-code reloading, error reporting, and more:

The application will start at http://localhost:3000 by default. The default port can be changed with -p, like so:

npx next dev -p 4000
Production
next start starts the application in production mode. The application should be compiled with next build first.

The application will start at http://localhost:3000 by default. The default port can be changed with -p, like so:

npx next start -p 4000
Telemetry
Next.js collects completely anonymous telemetry data about general usage. Participation in this anonymous program is optional, and you may opt-out if you'd not like to share any information.
