testparm options Description
equal hypothesize that the coefficients are equal to each other
equation(eqno) specify equation name or number for which the hypothesis is tested
nosvyadjust compute unadjusted Wald tests for survey results
df(#) use F distribution with # denominator degrees of freedom for the reference
distribution of the test statistic; for survey data, # specifies the design
degrees of freedom unless nosvyadjust is specified
df(#) does not appear in the dialog box.
test options Description
Options
mtest-

(opt)

test each condition separately
coef report estimated constrained coefficients
accumulate test hypothesis jointly with previously tested hypotheses
notest suppress the output
common test only variables common to all the equations
constant include the constant in coefficients to be tested
nosvyadjust compute unadjusted Wald tests for survey results
minimum perform test with the constant, drop terms until the test
becomes nonsingular, and test without the constant on the
remaining terms; highly technical
matvlc(matname) save the variance–covariance matrix; programmer’s option
df(#) use F distribution with # denominator degrees of freedom for the reference
distribution of the test statistic; for survey data, # specifies the design
degrees of freedom unless nosvyadjust is specified
matvlc(matname) and df(#) do not appear in the dialog box.
coeflist and varlist may contain factor variables and time-series operators; see [U] 11.4.3 Factor variables and
[U] 11.4.4 Time-series varlists.
collect is allowed with test; see [U] 11.1.10 Prefix commands.
