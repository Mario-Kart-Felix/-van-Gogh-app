Syntax 1 tests that coefficients are 0.
Syntax 2 tests that linear expressions are equal.
Syntax 3 tests that coefficients in eqno are 0.

name
coef identifies a coefficient in the model. coef is typically a variable name, a level indicator, an
interaction indicator, or an interaction involving continuous variables. Level indicators identify one
level of a factor variable and interaction indicators identify one combination of levels of an interaction;
see [U] 11.4.3 Factor variables. coef may contain time-series operators; see [U] 11.4.4 Time-series
varlists.
Distinguish between [ ], which are to be typed, and -
 , which indicate optional arguments.
Although not shown in the syntax diagram, parentheses around spec are required only with multiple
specifications. Also, the diagram does not show that test may be called without arguments to
redisplay the results from the last test.
anova and manova (see [R] anova and [MV] manova) allow the test syntax above plus more
(see [R] anova postestimation for test after anova; see [MV] manova postestimation for test
after manova).
Options for testparm
equal tests that the variables appearing in varlist, which also appear in the previously fit model, are
equal to each other rather than jointly equal to zero.
