test [price=weight], common
( 1) [price]foreign - [weight]foreign = 0
chi2( 1) = 23.07
Prob > chi2 = 0.0000
By default, test does not include the constant, the coefficient of the constant variable cons, in
the test. The cons option specifies that the constant be included.
. test [price=weight], common cons
( 1) [price]foreign - [weight]foreign = 0
( 2) [price]_cons - [weight]_cons = 0
chi2( 2) = 51.23
Prob > chi2 = 0.0000
We can also use a modification of this syntax with the model if we also type a colon and the names
of the variables we want to test:
. test [price=weight]: foreign
( 1) [price]foreign - [weight]foreign = 0
chi2( 1) = 23.07
Prob > chi2 = 0.0000
We have only one variable in common between the two equations, but if there had been more, we
could have listed them.
Finally, a simultaneous test of multiple constraints may be specified just as after single-equation
estimation.
. test ([price]: foreign) ([weight]: foreign)
( 1) [price]foreign = 0
( 2) [weight]foreign = 0
chi2( 2) = 31.61
Prob > chi2 = 0.0000
test can also test for equality of coefficients across more than two equations. For instance, test
[eq1=eq2=eq3] specifies a test that the coefficients in the three equations eq1, eq2, and eq3 are
equal. This requires that the same variables be included in the three equations. If some variables are
entered only in some of the equations, you can type test [eq1=eq2=eq3], common to test that the
coefficients of the variables common to all three equations are equal. Alternatively, you can explicitly
list the variables for which equality of coefficients across the equations is to be tested. For instance,
test [eq1=eq2=eq3]: time money tests that the coefficients of the variables time and money do
not differ between the equations.
Technical note
test [eq1=eq2=eq3], common tests the equality of the coefficients common to all equations,
but it does not test the equality of all common coefficients. Consider the case where
eq1 contains the variables var1 var2 var3
eq2 contains the variables var1 var2 var4
eq3 contains the variables var1 var3 var4
Obviously, only var1 is common to all three equations. Thus test [eq1=eq2=eq3], common
tests that the coefficients of var1 do not vary across the equations, so it is equivalent to test
[eq1=eq2=eq3]: var1. To perform a test of the coefficients of variables common to two equations,
you could explicitly list the constraints to be tested,
. test ([eq1=eq2=eq3]:var1) ([eq1=eq2]:var2) ([eq1=eq3]:var3) ([eq2=eq3]:var4
