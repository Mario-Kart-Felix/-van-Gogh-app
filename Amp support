Examples
AMP
With Next.js you can turn any React page into an AMP page, with minimal config, and without leaving React.

You can read more about AMP in the official amp.dev site.

Enabling AMP
To enable AMP support for a page, and to learn more about the different AMP configs, read the API documentation for next/amp.

Caveats
Only CSS-in-JS is supported. CSS Modules aren't supported by AMP pages at the moment. You can contribute CSS Modules support to Next.js.
