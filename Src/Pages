Pages can also be added under src/pages as an alternative to the root pages directory.

The src directory is very common in many apps and Next.js supports it by default.

Caveats
src/pages will be ignored if pages is present in the root directory
Config files like next.config.js and tsconfig.json should be inside the root directory, moving them to src won't work. Same goes for the public directory
