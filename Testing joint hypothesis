Example 5: Testing joint hypotheses
The real power of test is demonstrated when we test joint hypotheses. Perhaps we wish to test
whether the region variables, taken as a whole, are significant by testing whether the coefficients on
2.region, 3.region, and 4.region are simultaneously zero. test allows us to specify multiple
conditions to be tested, each embedded within parentheses.
. test (2.region=0) (3.region=0) (4.region=0)
( 1) 2.region = 0
( 2) 3.region = 0
( 3) 4.region = 0
F( 3, 44) = 8.85
Prob > F = 0.0001
test displays the set of conditions and reports an F statistic of 8.85. test also reports the degrees
of freedom of the test to be 3, the “dimension” of the hypothesis, and the residual degrees of freedom,
44. The significance level of the test is close to 0, so we can strongly reject the hypothesis of no
difference between the regions.
An alternative method to specify simultaneous hypotheses uses the convenient shorthand of
conditions with multiple equality operators.
. test 2.region=3.region=4.region=0
( 1) 2.region - 3.region = 0
( 2) 2.region - 4.region = 0
( 3) 2.region = 0
F( 3, 44) = 8.85
Prob > F = 0.0001
Technical note
Another method to test simultaneous hypotheses is to specify a test for each constraint and
accumulate it with the previous constraints:
. test 2.region=0
( 1) 2.region = 0
F( 1, 44) = 12.45
Prob > F = 0.0010
. test 3.region=0, accumulate
( 1) 2.region = 0
( 2) 3.region = 0
F( 2, 44) = 6.42
Prob > F = 0.0036
. test 4.region=0, accumulate
( 1) 2.region = 0
( 2) 3.region = 0
( 3) 4.region = 0
F( 3, 44) = 8.85
Prob > F = 0.0001
We tested the hypothesis that the coefficient on 2.region was zero by typing test 2.region=0.
We then tested whether the coefficient on 3.region was also zero by typing test 3.region=0,
accumulate. The accumulate option told Stata that this was not the start of a new test but a
continuation of a previous one. Stata responded by showing us the two equations and reporting an
F statistic of 6.42. The significance level associated with those two coefficients being zero is 0.36%.
