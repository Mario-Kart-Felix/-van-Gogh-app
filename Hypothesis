8 test — Test linear hypotheses after estimation
with an independent variable. You might type, for instance, test [#2]x1+[#2]x2=[#2]x3 to test
the constraint in equation 2 or, more readably, test [ford]x1+[ford]x2=[ford]x3, meaning that
Stata will test the constraint on the equation corresponding to ford, which might be equation 2. ford
would be an equation name after, say, sureg, or, after mlogit, ford would be one of the outcomes.
For mlogit, you could also type test [2]x1+[2]x2=[2]x3— note the lack of the #—meaning not
equation 2, but the equation corresponding to the numeric outcome 2. You can even test constraints
across equations: test [ford]x1+[ford]x2=[buick]x3.
The syntax
test coeflist
is available after all estimation commands and is a convenient way to test that multiple coefficients
are zero following estimation. A coeflist can simply be a list of variable names,
test varname -

varname . . . 
and it is most often specified that way. After you have fit a model of depvar on x1, x2, and x3,
typing test x1 x3 tests that the coefficients on x1 and x3 are jointly zero. After multiple-equation
estimation, this would test that the coefficients on x1 and x3 are zero in all equations that contain
them. You can also be more explicit and type, for instance, test [ford]x1 [ford]x3 to test that
the coefficients on x1 and x3 are zero in the equation for ford.
In the multiple-equation case, there are more alternatives. You could also test that the coefficients
on x1 and x3 are zero in the equation for ford by typing test [ford]: x1 x3. You could test that
all coefficients except the coefficient on the constant are zero in the equation for ford by typing test
[ford]. You could test that the coefficients on x1 and x3 in the equation for ford are equal to the
corresponding coefficients in the equation corresponding to buick by typing test[ford=buick]:
x1 x3. You could test that all the corresponding coefficients except the constant in three equations
are equal by typing test [ford=buick=volvo].
testparm is much like the first syntax of test. Its usefulness will be demonstrated below.
The examples below use regress, but what is said applies equally after any single-equation
estimation command (such as logistic). It also applies after multiple-equation estimation commands
as long as references to coefficients are qualified with an equation name or number in square brackets
placed before them. The convenient syntaxes for dealing with tests of many coefficients in multiple-
equation models are demonstrated in Special syntaxes after multiple-equation estimation below.
Example 1: Testing for a single coefficient against zero
We have 1980 census data on the 50 states recording the birth rate in each state (brate), the
median age (medage), and the region of the country in which each state is located.
The region variable is 1 if the state is in the Northeast, 2 if the state is in the North Central, 3
if the state is in the South, and 4 if the state is in the West. We estimate the following regression:
