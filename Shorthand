Shorthand varlist notation
Joint test that all coefficients on the indicators for a are 0 in all equations
testparm i.a
Joint test that all coefficients on the indicators for a are equal to each other in the first equation
testparm i.a, equal
As above, but for the equation for y4
testparm i.a, equal equation(y4)
Joint test that the coefficients on the indicators for a and b are equal to 0 in all equations
testparm i.a i.b
Joint test that all coefficients associated with the interaction of factors a and b are 0
testparm i.a#i.b
