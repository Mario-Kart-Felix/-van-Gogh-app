12 test â€” Test linear hypotheses after estimation
When we added the last constraint test 4.region=0, accumulate, we discovered that the three
region variables are significant. If all we wanted was the overall significance and we did not want to
bother seeing the interim results, we could have used the notest option:
. test 2.region=0, notest
( 1) 2.region = 0
. test 3.region=0, accumulate notest
( 1) 2.region = 0
( 2) 3.region = 0
. test 4.region=0, accumulate
( 1) 2.region = 0
( 2) 3.region = 0
( 3) 4.region = 0
F( 3, 44) = 8.85
Prob > F = 0.0001
Example 6: Quickly testing coefficients against zero
Because tests that coefficients are zero are so common in applied statistics, the test command
has a more convenient syntax to accommodate this case:
. test 2.region 3.region 4.region
( 1) 2.region = 0
( 2) 3.region = 0
( 3) 4.region = 0
F( 3, 44) = 8.85
Prob > F = 0.0001
Example 7: Specifying varlists
We will now show how to use testparm. In its first syntax, test accepts a list of variable names
but not a varlist.
. test i(2/4).region
i not found
r(111);
In the varlist, i(2/4).region means all the level variables from 2.region through 4.region,
yet we received an error. test does not actually understand varlists, but testparm does. In fact, it
understands only varlists.
. testparm i(2/4).region
( 1) 2.region = 0
( 2) 3.region = 0
( 3) 4.region = 0
F( 3, 44) = 8.85
Prob > F = 0.0001
Another way to test all the region variables is to type testparm i.region.
That testparm accepts varlists has other advantages that do not involve factor variables. Suppose
that we have a dataset that has dummy variables reg2, reg3, and reg4, rather than the categorical
variable region.
