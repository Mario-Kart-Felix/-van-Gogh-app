Description
test performs Wald tests of simple and composite linear hypotheses about the parameters of the
most recently fit model.
test supports svy estimators (see [SVY] svy estimation), carrying out an adjusted Wald test by
default in such cases. test can be used with svy estimation results, see [SVY] svy postestimation.
testparm provides a useful alternative to test that permits varlist rather than a list of coefficients
(which is often nothing more than a list of variables), allowing the use of standard Stata notation,
including ‘-’ and ‘*’, which are given the expression interpretation by test.
test and testparm perform Wald tests. For likelihood-ratio tests, see [R] lrtest. For Wald-type
tests of nonlinear hypotheses, see [R] testnl. To display estimates for one-dimensional linear or
nonlinear expressions of coefficients, see [R] lincom and [R] nlcom.

Quick start
Linear tests after single-equation models
Joint test that the coefficients on x1 and x2 are equal to 0
test x1 x2
Joint test that coefficients on factor indicators 2.a and 3.a are equal to 0
test 2.a 3.a
Test that coefficients on indicators 2.a and 3.a are equal
test 2.a = 3.a
Joint test that coefficients on indicators 1.a, 2.a, and 3.a are all equal
test (1.a=2.a) (1.a=3.a)
Same as above
test 1.a=2.a=3.a
As above, but add separate tests for each pairing
test 1.a=2.a=3.a, mtest
As above, but with p-values adjusted for multiple comparisons using Sid ˇ ak’s method ´
test (1.a=2.a) (1.a=3.a), mtest(sidak)
